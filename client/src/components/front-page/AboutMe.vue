        <p>
          I am a junior software engineer currently studying towards a first-class BEng (Hons) Software
          Engineering degree at Edinburgh Napier University. I am passionate about financial services
          and aspiring to drive change in this sector through fintech. As part of my third year at
          University I had the opportunity to undertake a 12 month industrial placement at Morgan Stanley
          where I worked on a market leading event-driven equity swaps trading system and developed enterprise
          tools for developers in the company. This allowed me to greatly elevate both my technical and professional skills.
          Now I am completing a Business Analyst internship at MarketAxess to learn more about the role of a Business Analyst and
          the fixed income trading space. I also hope this will allow me to make a better choice for my career after graduation.
        <p>
          My professional experience includes enterprise Java systems, database development on DB2 and Sybase, full
          stack development with Angular 6, Python and Java, API development and performance tuning. Currently I am
          learning to write high level and detailed business specifications and other Business Analyst tasks.
